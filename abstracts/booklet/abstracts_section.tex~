\noindent Sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) on Georges Bank are important 
both ecologically and as commercial fisheries. The population is comprised of 3 
distinct scallop beds, which are connected via transport of planktonic larvae sp
awned in the spring and fall. In order to develop sustainable management strateg
ies and predict effects of climate change on the population, we need to quantify
 how the different beds and spawning times contribute to larval recruitment. ^M
Here, we calculate larval drift and retention using a 3D particle-tracking model
, which couples seasonal currents, larval swimming, turbulent dispersion and lar
val development. Bed connectivity is quantified, and patterns of larval exchange
 are shown to differ for each season. Sensitivity to variation in adult distribu
tion, temperature-dependent growth, reproduction and mortality is assessed. Fact
ors controlling long-term success of the scallop population are analyzed using a
 modified Markov-chain approach. Implications for management of this population 
in the context of climate change are discussed.

\noindent We examined the water-column impacts of mussel farming in Ship Harbour
 (Nova Scotia) using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) coupled with an e
cosystem model containing a sessile filter-feeder sub-model. For model tuning an
d ground-truthing, we used data from a variety of bio-optical instruments and wa
ter samples, collected during multiple transects conducted at each tidal cycle o
ver 4 days and nights. We used our model to quantify the effect of mussels on wa
ter-column variables by estimating the difference between model simulations with
 and without mussels. The resulting 3-D maps of mussel-associated impacts showed
 a time-averaged decrease in phytoplankton and small detritus (up to 45 and 15\%
, respectively), and an increase in large detritus, ammonia and nitrate (up to 1
4, 3 and 2\%, respectively). In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of 3
-D coupled models for aquaculture management. However, we also emphasize the nee
d for continuous records of at least two independent estimates of phytoplankton 
to tune and ground-truth models, and ultimately, to understand the impact of biv

\noindent The western equatorial Pacific (WEP) is a highly dynamic region, playi
ng a significant role in both tropical and extra-tropical climates through its s
trong influence on the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, the E
ast Asian monsoon, and the position of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ
).  While the modern behaviours of these climate systems are well understood, pa
st behaviours are subject to debate.  We intend to reconstruct paleo-precipitati
on patterns in the WEP, which are linked to ENSO and ITCZ dynamics, by quantifyi
ng n-alkane composition and abundance in samples from several sediment cores alo
ng a N-S transect.  N-alkanes are unique to terrestrial leaf waxes, and can thus
 be used to monitor fluvial influx of terrigenous material into the ocean from a
djacent landmasses.  The simplistic assumption is that variations in regional pr
ecipitation can be inferred from changes in this influx; however, there are othe
r factors, such as sea level fluctuation, which may affect the sedimentary recor
d and complicate our interpretation.  We hypothesize that zonal shifts in precip
itation due to ENSO-like variability should affect all of our core sites similar
ly.  In contrast, meridional precipitation shifts due to ITCZ migration should r
esult in opposing trends at our core sites.  Here, we present preliminary result
s from three core sites and discuss what they suggest with respect to resolving 
glacial-interglacial climate and ocean dynamics.

\noindent Shellfish carrying-capacity is determined by the interaction of cultur
ed species with the ecosystem, principally constrained by environmental characte
ristics and particularly food availability. A recent experiment carried out in L
ysefjord (SW Norway) has shown that artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deeper
 water stimulated phytoplankton growth, potentially increasing the carrying-capa
city for mussel cultivation. With the aim of evaluating aquaculture effects and 
assisting in development of sustainable mussel culture in Lysefjord, an object-o
riented model of environmental-mussel aquaculture interactions and mussel carryi
ng-capacity was constructed. A multiple box ecosystem model was developed with h
ighly configurable GUI-based software (Simile) that allows explicit coupling bet
ween boxes, which represent regions of the fjord. Once the box model was develop
ed and calibrated, subsequent application of PEST (Parameter ESTimation) allowed
 optimization of different variables of the model in order to manage mussel prod
uction according to carrying-capacity criteria. The Simile model and the simulta
neous application of PEST allowed several scenarios taking into account differen
t stocking densities and the creation of new cultivation areas.

\noindent This study characterizes ecological interactions between populations o
f two native Cancer spp. and the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, in Barkle
y Sound, British Columbia. Laboratory salinity tolerance tests demonstrated that
 C. maenas had a higher mean tolerance to osmotic stress when compared to Cancer
 productus and C. gracilis with the latter being the least tolerant. Trapping su
rveys revealed depth segregated populations of C. gracilis and C. maenas - depth
 distributions for both spp. fluctuated over time and were significantly related
 to salinity and ultimately regional rainfall. It is suggested that osmoconformi
ng C. gracilis retreats to deeper waters at times corresponding to a depressed h
alocline coinciding with heavy freshwater input. Co-occurrence of C. maenas and 
C. productus was extremely rare. The smaller sized osmoregulating C. maenas seem
 relegated to areas of high freshwater discharge due to biotic resistance by lar
ger native crabs. These findings suggest that halotolerance may have facilitated
 the establishment of green crab populations on Canada's west coast. Salinity to
lerance data are valuable for assessing the risk of further invasions in estuari
es along British Columbia's coast and similar environments.

\noindent Methane, an important greenhouse gas, is produced in both wetlands and
 aquatic sediments (marine and freshwater) by the degradation of organic matter 
under anoxic conditions.  Once produced, methane can migrate from the sediments 
to the overlying water and eventually the atmosphere by diffusion or bubble ebul
lition.   Ebullition is a significant source because it can release methane dire
ctly to the water column or atmosphere, bypassing the methane oxidizing zone, wh
ich consumes much of the diffusive flux of methane.  Here I present a mechanisti
c model for bubble rise in soft sediments.   The model describes the movement of
 a single isolated bubble.  The bubble migrates by propagating a fracture and th
e rate of rise is controlled by the viscoelastic response of the sediments to st
resses induced by the bubble.  The model predicts rise velocities as a function 
of measurable sediment properties and shows that such velocities are significant
ly faster than the time scale of diffusive release.

he rate of sediment transport. The focus of this study is long wavelength ripple
s (LWRs) observed at two locations in the nearshore at roughly 3m water depth un
der combined current and wave conditions in Duck, North Carolina. The observed L
WRs are straight-crested bedforms with wavelengths in the range of 30-75 cm. The
y occur during the build up of storms, when the incident wave direction is rapid
ly changing, possibly due to the migration of the center of a storm. A principal
 goal of the study is to test the maximum gross bedform-normal transport (mGBNT)
 hypothesis, which states that the orientation of ripples in directionally varyi
ng flows is such that the gross sediment transport normal to the ripple crest is
 maximized. Ripple wavelengths and orientation are measured from rotary fanbeam 
images and current and wave conditions are obtained from electromagnetic (EM) fl
owmeters and an offshore pressure gauge array. Tests of the mGBNT hypothesis in 
which the transport was calculated using a sediment transport model indicate tha
t it is not a good predictor of LWR orientation. The observed LWR orientation se
ems to be tied to the incident wave direction, with an additional offset the sig
n of which depends on the sign of the longshore current.

microstructure that scatter sound. Acoustic measurements of turbulent fluctuatio
ns are translated into physical parameters using models that generally assume is
otropic scattering, although there is no clear experimental evidence to support 
this. We investigate the existence of anisotropy in small-scale turbulence gener
ated by internal waves. Strong anisotropy is predicted to noticeably shift the d
issipative roll-off in the spectral frequency response of turbulence to lower fr
equencies. Observations of scatter from turbulence are made using a broadband ac
oustic system that is capable of sampling vertically or horizontally through the
 water column. The overall scatter shows statistical patterns in spectral shape 
that suggest the presence of anisotropy in either biological or physical scatter
. Turbulence dissipation rates are estimated from acoustic inversions of spectra
 and yield no clear evidence of small-scale turbulence anisotropy.

 Mean dynamic topography (MDT) is the mean variation of the height of the ocean 
relative to the geoid, and can be related to the mean circulation by an assumpti
on of geostrophy. Poor knowledge of the geoid has prevented direct measurement o
f MDT, and estimates have been based on indirect methods using hydrographic data
. However the GRACE satellite gravity mission is providing detailed information 
on the geoid and its temporal change, leading to improved estimates of MDT. GRAC
E also provides the mass change of the ocean which, when combined with hydrograp

 and ocean warming to total sea level rise. Studies of the spatial pattern of se
a level change have tended to simplify the ocean response. There is scope to int

 oceanography; it contributes to fluxes of heat and salt, and redistributes chem

ongoing studies in the St. Lawrence Estuary have identified regions of internal 
wave propagation and dissipation, but to date little has been done to examine th
e generation phase. Fieldwork performed in the summer of 2008 identified a poten

\noindent The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of atmospheri
c variability in the tropical atmosphere on intraseasonal timescales (i.e., week
s to seasons).  It is an eastward-propagating phenomenon with clear expressions 
in outgoing longwave radiation, precipitation and zonal wind stress over the tro
pical oceans.  The MJO has the potential to help bridge the gap between between 
extended-range weather forecasts and seasonal climate forecasts of both the atmo
sphere and ocean.  Observational and modeling studies have shown that the MJO ca
n drive variability in the tropical ocean through local heat and momentum fluxes
. In this study we examine the connection between sea level and the MJO on a glo
bal scale. We first identify regions exhibiting a significant (both statistical 
and practical) relationship between sea level and the MJO. The first region cons
ists of the equatorial Pacific and western coast zones of North and South Americ
a. Consistent with previous studies, we identify wind-driven equatorially trappe
d Kelvin waves propagating eastward along the equatorial Pacific and then polewa
rd along the coastal trapped waveguides of North and South America.  The second 
region includes the shallow waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria along the north co
ast of Australia and the adjacent Arafura and Timor Seas. Sea level set up by on
shore winds is shown to be the dominant physical process. Finally, the northeast
ern Indian Ocean is shown to be a complex region involving a combination of equa
torially trapped Kelvin waves, coastal trapped waves and westward propagating Ro
ssby waves exhibiting characteristics of both local and remote forcing. The impl
ications for deep and coastal ocean forecasting are discussed.

ony diameter, and relative interannual patterns in abundance. We used the model 
to examine the relative effect on the population of varying temperature by -2 to
 +2$^{\circ}$C day$^{-1}$. Increasing daily temperature by 2$^{\circ}$C caused t
he population to occur 1 month earlier in the season, and resulted in a 100 fold
 increase in abundance. Changes in winter and summer temperature had the most pr

idate aquaculture species, Haliotis kamtschatkana, exhibits density-dependent gr
owth we raised animals at three density levels and two food treatments: unlimite
d (ad libitum) and rationed (individual portions were the same among density tre
atments). We also tested for differences in food consumption, foraging patterns 
and stacking behaviour among the density levels. We observed density-dependent g
rowth in the rationed treatments, indicating that relatively high growth rates a
t lower densities are driven, in part, by factors other than differences in food
 consumption.However, overall the quantity of food consumed related directly to 
growth; treatments fed ad libitum had higher growth rates. Furthermore, even whe
n food was provided in excess, foraging was restricted to $\sim$2 h after sunset
 in all treatments and the amount consumed per abalone was significantly lower a
t high densities. This is probably because high density animals could not access
 the food provided: fewer were observed foraging and they had to move from promi
nent stacks. Our results indicate that both temporal and spatial access to food 
are critical and that managers can observe foraging and stacking by abalone in t
anks to determine if a specific design will limit food consumption, and ultimate
ly growth.

\noindent Ocean-going vessels pose a threat to large whales worldwide and are re
sponsible for the majority of deaths diagnosed among endangered North Atlantic r
ight whales (\sl Eubalaena glacialis\rm). Various conservation measures, includi
ng vessel re-routing and vessel-speed restrictions, have been implemented to red
uce vessel-strike mortality in this species. We initiated the Vessel Avoidance &
 Conservation Area Transit Experiment (VACATE) to evaluate the efficacy of a vol
untary and seasonal Area to be Avoided (ATBA) in reducing the risk of lethal ves
sel-strikes. The ATBA was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IM
O) for the Roseway Basin region of the Scotian Shelf in 2008. The effectiveness 
of this vessel-avoidance scheme in reducing risk without the imposition of vesse
l-speed restrictions is entirely dependent on vessel-operator compliance.  Using
 a network of Automatic Identification System receivers we collected static, dyn
amic, and voyage-related vessel data in the Roseway Basin region, both pre- and 
post-implementation of the ATBA.  Our analyses show that semimonthly estimates o
f vessel-operator voluntary compliance range from 57\% to 87\%, and stabilised a
t 71\% within the first 5 months of implementation.  Using pre- and post-impleme
ntation vessel-navigation and speed data, along with right whale sightings per u
nit effort data, we estimate an 82\% reduction in the risk of lethal vessel-stri
kes to right whales that is due to vessel-operator compliance. The high level of
 compliance achieved with this voluntary conservation initiative is likely due t
o the ATBA being adopted by the IMO. Through VACATE we demonstrate that the inte
rnational shipping industry is able and willing to voluntarily alter course to p
rotect endangered whales.

\noindent As a first step of developing a nested-grid circulation model for the 
eastern Canadian shelf, we constructed a coarse-grid (1/4$^\circ$) northwest Atl
antic circulation model using the ocean general circulation model known as OPA (
Oc\'{e}an PArall\'{e}lis\'{e}). The model domain covers the area between 32$^\ci
rc$W and 81$^\circ$W and between 33$^\circ$N and 57$^\circ$N. This model was use
d to simulate the 3-D circulation from 1990 to 1999 in this study. The model was
 forced by atmospheric reanalysis fields produced by Large and Yeager (2004) and
 monthly mean climatologies of temperature and salinity produced by Geshelin et 
al. (1999). Three different numerical experiments were conducted to examine the 
model performance in simulating large-scale circulation over the study region. T
hese three experiments are: a) a fully prognostic run without data assimilation;
 b) a run using the spectral nudging method (Thompson et al. 2006); and c) a run
 using the semi-prognostic method (Sheng et al. 2001). In the first experiment n
o hydrographical assimilation is made and model results in this experiment demon
strate significant model drift and unrealistic circulation features for a multi-
year model integration. For the spectral nudging experiment the model drift in T
S fields is significantly reduced and the hydrographical seasonal cycle is well 
reproduced by the model as expected. However, tracer variability in this run is 
strongly damped and the eddy field is less free to evolve in the model. In the s
emi-prognostic run a correction (or assimilation) term is introduced in the mode
l through the hydrostatic equation while leaving the model tracer equations to b
e fully prognostic. Model results demonstrate that the semi-prognostic method no
t only reduces model drift but also improves the flow field simulation. This met
hod however still damps the mesoscale eddy field. Future work will include the u
se of a smoothed semi-prognostic method which allows the mesoscale eddy field to
 be more realistically reproduced.

\noindent Significant correlation between temporal variations of sea surface hei
ght anomalies in the Loop Current region and transport variations through the Yu
catan Channel in the Intra-Americas Sea is found based on the analysis of numeri
cal model results and satellite-altimeter data. Transport in the model is found 
to be a minimum when the Loop Current intrudes strongly into the Gulf of Mexico,
 typically just before a ring is shed, and to be a maximum during the next growt
h phase in association with the build up of warm water off the northwest coast o
f Cuba. Numerical experiments show that the transport variations result from the
 interaction between the density anomalies associated with Loop Current intrusio
n and the variable bottom topography. A proxy for low-frequency transport variat
ions through the Yucatan Channel is then proposed, which compares well with the 
2-year transport estimates for the Yucatan Channel during the CANEK program (10 
September 1999 to 31 May 2001). A 10-year comparison between the transport proxy
 and the cable data sheds light on the influence of Loop Current intrusion on th
e Florida Current between Florida and the Bahamas.

\noindent A high-resolution, three-dimensional coastal circulation model was con
structed for Jiaozhou Bay and adjacent coastal waters using the finite-volume me
thod (FVM). The main advantage of the FVM is that complex coastline and irregula
r topography can easily be represented in the model by unstructured triangular g
rid. The coastal circulation model has a fine-resolution of $\sim$30 m for harbo
urs and Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center and uses the wet/dry lateral boundaries f
or the inter-tidal zone. The model results demonstrate that tides in Jiaozhou Ba
y are mainly semi-diurnal. Outside Jiaozhou Bay, tidal waves propagate from the 
northeast to southwest with a cyclonic rotation. As approaching the mouth of Jia
ozhou Bay, tidal currents bifurcate: with one continually propagates to southwes
t along the coastline, the other one propagates into inner Jiaozhou Bay with inc
reasing amplitude. Near the mouth of Jiaozhou Bay, Eulerian residual currents ha
ve a multi-eddy structure, with surface residual tidal currents greater than the
 bottom currents. Tidal energy propagates from the northeast to southwest outsid
e Jiaozhou Bay. Near the mouth of Jiaozhou Bay part of tidal energy transmits to
 southwest along the coastline, the other part of energy converges at mouth of J
iaozhou Bay, and then diverges to the inward Bay. A numerical dye release experi
ment demonstrates that the mouth of Jiaozhou Bay is an active zone of water exch
ange.

\noindent Conservation of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) requ
ires mortalities caused by human activities to be significantly reduced. Entangl
ement in fishing gear is considered an important cause of mortality and one that
 is underestimated. In order to reduce this risk, we must know where the whales 
are, where the gear is and the probability of lethal outcome if an encounter bet
ween the two occurs. An important component of this concerns the groundline, a r
ope used to attach traps (e.g. crab, lobster) in a series (trawl). A common assu
mption is that groundlines form arches in the water column and are a threat to w
hales. Many fishermen have challenged this interpretation. This research measure
d the elevations of groundlines in the Bay of Fundy and evaluated several factor
s that could influence them. Sensors were attached to nineteen groundlines on se
ven different lobster trawls that were being actively fished in the Bay of Fundy
 and elevations were recorded for at least two days. Results suggest that ground
lines are within 3 m of the bottom most of the time, but groundlines of poorly s
et trawls may reach as high as 7 m. Although many factors did not influence elev
ations (e.g. water depth), some did (e.g. current velocity) and it was concluded
 that as a result of these influencing factors, fishermen in the Bay of Fundy ca
n help ensure that their groundlines remain low, reducing the risk to right whal
es.

\noindent By understanding factors that influence parameters related to photosyn
thesis, better estimates of primary productivity and particle dynamics can be ob
tained. We describe a new method to estimate photoacclimation, a physiological p
rocess that influences both photosynthesis vs. irradiance (\sl P \rm vs. \sl E\r
m) parameters and chemical composition of phytoplankton, based on profiles of \s
l in situ \rm fluorescence and irradiance and apply it to examine the variabilit
y of phytoplankton photoacclimation in relation to environmental variables.^MPro
files of \sl in situ \rm chlorophyll fluorescence have been routinely measured d
uring oceanographic surveys for several decades. Near surface decreases of fluor
escence yield, chlorophyll fluorescence normalized to some measure of phytoplank
ton biomass, are commonly observed during daytime profiles. This decrease in flu
orescence is due to physiological processes, activated in high irradiance, which
 act to dissipate light energy absorbed by phytoplankton. Lab studies show that 
the irradiance at which this quenching of fluorescence yield begins is related t
o a parameter used to estimate primary productivity. With the simple requirement
s of irradiance and fluorescence yield profiles, this method can be applied to m
any existing datasets. Examining variations of the light level where fluorescenc
e quenching begins in response to environmental variables such as average light 
in the mixed layer, will provide new information on how phytoplankton acclimate 
to their environment.

re tested. It was found that treatment time did not lead to significant changes

 that the more abrasive solvents extracted a greater concentration of pigment fr

tures for 22 months. It was found that samples stored below freezing yielded a s

\noindent Defining habitat critical for the survival of endangered species is th
e goal of many marine science initiatives. In the pelagic zone, feeding habitat 
boundaries are difficult to define statically in space because the prey-field is
 subject to advection and mixing by regional flow fields. Here we address this i
ssue in relation to defining the critical feeding habitat of the endangered Nort
h Atlantic right whale. These whales feed on diapausing, lipid rich copepods tha
t are aggregated in high concentrations, near bottom, in the deep (>100m) basins
 of the Scotia-Fundy region. We ask can variation in the spatial distribution of
 the right whale prey-field at short (tidal, diel) time scales be explained by v
ariation in the current regime in Roseway Basin. Current speed and acoustic back
scatter (zooplankton abundance) data were simultaneously collected using mooring
s at three locations in the Basin. Two moorings, fitted with upward looking Acou
stic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP; one 300 kHz and one 600 kHz), downward loo
king Aquadopp profilers, and CTDs (SBE-37), straddled a sloping region on the ed
ge of the Basin where whales feed and were located within one tidal excursion fr
om one another. The third mooring (upward looking 300 kHz ADCP) was located at t
he deepest portion of the Basin. The area was concurrently surveyed using a ship
-mounted echo-sounder (Simrad, 120 kHz). We illustrate how zooplankton abundance
 varies in response to tidal advection of water masses and the residual circulat
ion.
