Things to do for the cdogs website scripts:
* change templates (tex, html, etc) so that the DATE only has to be
updated in one place.
* update submit scripts to be more clear about latex/msword codes, and
to deal with middle names/initials.
* create scripts to create booklet and website schedule from submitted abstracts and a
"schedule" file.
* Fix CDOGS logo (vecorize)
* Fix latex help page (make texsym graphics local)
* add \label to abstracts for booklet

Schedule file:
* Will need to be able to differentiate between SPEAKER rows, which
will be associated with an abstract that must be included, and ITEM
rows, which contain information like: Opening, Break, etc ....


Files where date must be updated:
* index.php
* head.php
* welcome.php
* cdogs_abstract_tex_template_book_top
* cdogs_abstract_tex_template_top
