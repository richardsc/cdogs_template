  <text> Quantitative comparison of model results with measured data is an essential part of model skill assessment and data assimilation. Specifically, we are seeking a suitable measure of fit for comparing surface ocean satellite images with corresponding model output. We evaluated a variety of distance measures including the commonly used Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) error, and other metrics from the image comparison literature. In our assessment simple pixel-by-pixel comparison like the RMS error yield unsatisfactory results in many cases. We will present examples that demonstrate the advantages of alternative image distance and fit measures, for example a modified version of the Hausdorff distance, which we adapted for use with (partially incomplete) satellite images. </text>
