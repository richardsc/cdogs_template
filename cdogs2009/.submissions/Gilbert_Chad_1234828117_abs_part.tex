\noindent Sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) on Georges Bank are important both ecologically and as commercial fisheries. The population is comprised of 3 distinct scallop beds, which are connected via transport of planktonic larvae spawned in the spring and fall. In order to develop sustainable management strategies and predict effects of climate change on the population, we need to quantify how the different beds and spawning times contribute to larval recruitment. Here, we calculate larval drift and retention using a 3D particle-tracking model, which couples seasonal currents, larval swimming, turbulent dispersion and larval development. Bed connectivity is quantified, and patterns of larval exchange are shown to differ for each season. Sensitivity to variation in adult distribution, temperature-dependent growth, reproduction and mortality is assessed. Factors controlling long-term success of the scallop population are analyzed using a modified Markov-chain approach. Implications for management of this population in the context of climate change are discussed.
