Each talk is scheduled to be 12 minutes long, with about 2 minutes for
questions afterwards. Session chairs will be keeping an eye on the
clock. Make sure that your talk can fit into the time slot you have.

<li>
Remember that the goal of these talks is for you to explain
what you have done (are doing/will do) to people who are not in your
lab. Please keep your talk general.

<font color=red> Anyone wishing to use Powerpoint, please be aware that 
we are
requesting your presentations by Wednesday, March 3</font>. This is so that
we can make sure that your presentation will work with no unexpected
problems.

<li> 
The room that we were able to obtain (un)fortunately has lots of windows without curtains, so make sure your presentation is high on contrast!
